Repo for learning Git

I'm trying to teach myself `Git` and `Markdown` *at the same time*.

I already have quite a bit of `Markdown` basic syntax from using Slack. Plus, I know `HTML`, so I've got that going for me, which is nice.

I'm going to go finish the last bit of pulled pork mac and cheese in the fridge. **Enjoy your day.**
